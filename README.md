Birdhouse with camera that records video's when a bird is detected inside.
The camera records for 5 minutes and the video's are saved on an ownCloud storage server running on the Raspberry Pi.
The Raspberry Pi is configured as an acces point/gateway so it serves as a network to connect with.
You can acces the videos in the cloud when you are near the birdhouse with a device you can connect to the network of the birdhouse and by going on the ip address from the Raspberry Pi 
The Raspberry Pi has it's own battery and solar panel for power.
